# BookCRUDoperation
library based project by using Django CRUD operation
here i am using built in admin (authentication and authorization process) @login_required(login_url='login')
Django login required function used to secure views (if not request.user.is_authenticated:)

seperating the every new user to login and save that user into the admin user

after that the process was started to running the code every new user add book in library
for that user seen that book but for the student view all library book seen
